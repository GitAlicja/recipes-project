After 10 minutes, add the garlic and roast for another 5-10 minutes until golden, before removing from the oven and leaving to one side. Put the pasta in a pan of boiling water and cook to the instructions on the pack. Once cooked, drain and leave to one side. Place the almond milk, spinach and salt in a pan over a medium heat and cook until the spinach has wilted. Once wilted, add the roasted garlic and blend using a hand blender (or pour the sauce into a normal blender) until smooth - if youâ€™re adding nutritional yeast, add it to your blender now. Mix through the courgettes and peas, and cook for another 5 minutes. Finally, stir the lemon juice through through the pasta before serving.",
